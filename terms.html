        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: October 2025</p>

        <p>
            Welcome to Loopo! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Loopo mobile application and services (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
        </p>

        </ul>

        <h2>4. Service Description</h2>
        <p>
            Loopo is a social marketplace platform that connects individuals ("Buyers") seeking to purchase items with individuals ("Sellers") offering to sell items. Loopo facilitates the connection and transaction process but does not directly sell, buy, or take ownership of any items listed on the platform. We are not responsible for the quality, safety, or legality of items advertised, the truth or accuracy of listings, or the ability of sellers to sell items or buyers to pay for items.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Buyer Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Due Diligence:</strong> Buyers are responsible for reviewing item descriptions, photos, and communicating with sellers to clarify any questions before making a purchase.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment:</strong> Buyers agree to pay for items purchased through the Service in a timely manner.</li>
            <li><strong>Inspection:</strong> Upon receipt of an item, buyers should inspect it promptly and report any issues according to Loopo's dispute resolution process.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Seller Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accurate Listings:</strong> Sellers agree to provide accurate, complete, and truthful descriptions and photos of items for sale.</li>
            <li><strong>Item Quality:</strong> Sellers warrant that items sold are as described, free from defects (unless disclosed), and safe for use.</li>
            <li><strong>Shipping/Delivery:</strong> Sellers are responsible for timely and secure shipping or delivery of items to buyers.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Sellers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the sale of their items.</li>
            <li><strong>Prohibited Items:</strong> Sellers must not list any items that are illegal, stolen, or violate Loopo's Prohibited Items Policy (which may be updated from time to time).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Prohibited Activities</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</li>
            <li>Harass, abuse, or harm another person or group.</li>
            <li>Impersonate any person or entity.</li>
            <li>Interfere with or disrupt the Service or servers or networks connected to the Service.</li>
            <li>Engage in any fraudulent activity, including but not limited to misrepresenting items, making false claims, or attempting off-platform transactions to avoid fees or security measures.</li>
            <li>Post or transmit any content that is offensive, defamatory, obscene, or infringes on intellectual property rights.</li>
            <li>Attempt to manipulate prices or interfere with other users' listings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Payments, Fees, and Escrow System</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> Loopo facilitates secure payments through integrated payment gateways (e.g., GCash, Maya, PayMongo, PayPal).</li>
            <li><strong>Fees:</strong> Loopo may charge fees for its services (e.g., transaction fees, listing fees), which will be clearly disclosed to you.</li>
            <li><strong>Escrow System:</strong> For certain transactions, Loopo may utilize an escrow-style system where payments are held securely until the buyer confirms satisfactory receipt of the item. This is designed to protect both buyers and sellers.</li>
            <li><strong>Fraud Prevention:</strong> Loopo reserves the right to withhold or cancel payments if fraud or a violation of these Terms is suspected.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Disclaimer & Safety Notice</h2>
        <div class="important-notice">
            <h3>Mahalaga: Ingat sa mga Scam! (Beware of Scams!)</h3>
            <p>
                Loopo is committed to providing a safe and secure marketplace. However, users must always exercise caution and good judgment.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Off-Platform Transactions:</strong> NEVER engage in transactions or payments outside of the Loopo app. This bypasses our security features, escrow system, and fraud detection. Loopo cannot protect you if you transact off-platform. Kaya iwas-scam tayo dito sa Loopo â€“ gamitin lang ang app sa lahat ng transaksyon!</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Be wary of requests for excessive personal information (e.g., bank account details, passwords) from other users.</li>
                <li><strong>AI Scam Detection:</strong> Our platform employs AI-powered text flagging to identify and alert users to potentially suspicious messages or activities. However, this is a tool and not a guarantee against all fraud. Always use your best judgment.</li>
                <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> If you encounter any suspicious activity, inappropriate content, or potential scams, please report it immediately through the in-app reporting system or by contacting <a href="mailto:support@loopo.ph">support@loopo.ph</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Guidelines:</strong> Adhere to our Community Guidelines (available separately) to foster a respectful and safe environment for all users.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Loopo provides tools to help, but ultimately, your safety is also in your hands. Mag-ingat po tayo palagi!
